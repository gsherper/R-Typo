# Backstory

The game is set in the middle of 22nd century, and the player flies a futuristic fighter craft called the R-9a "Arrowhead", named for its shape, and because it is the ninth model in the 'R' series of fighter craft (but it is the first of the series to actually be used in combat; the previous models were all prototypes). 

The R-9a is warped into an alternate dimension called the NES. Unknown what the future holds, the player must control R-9a and move forward in hopes of returning back to its original dimension SNES.
